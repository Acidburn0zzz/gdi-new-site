        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <hr>
      </div>
      <p class="large">“Girl, Develop It!” began as a call to action for women, by women who were tired of the low representation of women in tech, and wanted to make a difference. Girl Develop It was founded in New York City in 2010 by Vanessa Hurst and Sara Chipps. Find out our more about their current projects below. Today, there are Girl Develop It chapters building strong communities in 45 US cities (and growing), representing 29,000 members nationwide who are changing their lives through learning to code with us. </p>
