        <h2>Sara Chipps // Co-founder</h2>
        <p>Sara is the CTO of Levo League, where she focuses on developer happiness as a metric for success. In 2010, she cofounded Girl Develop It because she thinks that the development community could use a few more ladies.</p>
        <p>Sara blogs at SaraJChipps.com and enjoys speaking to and meeting with diverse groups from the Girl Scouts to straight up code junkies. Sara's favorite language is JavaScript, and she thinks coffee is for drinking not coding.</p>
